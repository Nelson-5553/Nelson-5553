## My Contributions

During my internship at the Innovation Center, I actively participated in projects focused on developing technological solutions and improving user interfaces for various internal systems. One of my main achievements was the complete redesign of the [Ikarus Project](/sections/proyectos?page=1) interface, optimizing its user experience and adapting it to modern design standards.

I also worked on the creation and development of custom modules, such as tools for managing event calendars and dynamic carousels. These solutions not only improved the organization and presentation of information but also made it easier for users to access and interact with existing systems.

My contribution also included the development of dynamic text functionalities, responsive design implementations, and testing to ensure the stability and efficiency of the applications created.

## Impact

Thanks to my contribution, the Innovation Center achieved:

- Improved user interaction with the developed platforms.

- Increased efficiency in the management of internal events and projects.

- Raised design standards in the center's technological products.

This experience not only strengthened my technical and creative skills but also gave me the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment, facing challenges and learning continuously.
